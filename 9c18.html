How siliciclastic varies along the margin?&nbsp;How differential subsidence along the margin affected siliciclastic distribution?</li></ul><div>The more tropical conditions in NWS than in SWS possibly intensify run-off activity, and subsequent, siliciclastic transport and deposition. However, it also intensifies carbonate production, and so the siliciclastic signal may not be clear. At the same time, differential subsidence should be less pronounce in SWS, so we expected a more condensed section for Cenozoic sedimentation. Exp 356 results suggest that west Australia became wetter during the late Miocene creating a climate gradient with the arid interior, while northwest Australia remained arid throughout (Groneveld et al., 2017). That should also be reflected in Qz% and K% in SWS.</div><div><div></div><div></div></div><div></div>
