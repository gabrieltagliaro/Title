<div>PROPOSAL SUMMARY</div><div></div><div>The Neogene is a period when the Earth underwent through drastic modifications in the processes that ultimately control the evolution of sedimentary systems: climate and tectonics. It is in the Neogene that Earth’s continental plates acquired its modern shape, modifying sea level and patterns of oceanic currents that intensified ongoing climatic changes. At the same time, a pulse in tectonic activity generated new orogenic areas, increasing the availability of source rocks. Sedimentary systems, as a secondary process in Earth’s system, respond promptly to the reorganization of the primary forces, and hence, the signals of the Neogene events are recorded in the stratigraphic record of continental margins.</div><div></div><div>Particularly, influxes of siliciclastic sediment in global continental margins have been observed in the middle-to-late Miocene period&nbsp;(Lavier 2001, Steckler 1999, Sanchez 2012, Tcherepanov 2010, Lu 2004). An increase in orogeny, and an abrupt change in global δ18O(‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak&nbsp;are also documented for this 10 Ma interval&nbsp;(Potter et al., 2009; Potter et al., 2015). Cooler temperatures are hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expeditions 356 - Indonesian Throughflow and 369 - Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics are recovering Neogene strata in the Western Continental Margin of Australia, representing a latitudinal transect of cores from 17S to 35S, fully comprehending the Western Australian Margin. This research proposal is developed within the major objectives of Expeditions 356 and 369, and intends to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. The project is split depending on the focus area, and the main methodology used (seismic stratigraphy; core and log correlation; numerical modeling). A three-step research approach is proposed: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div>The project will test several individual hypotheses (see proposal in detail), clarifying local and regional problems, but ultimately, we intend to contribute to two main scientific problems: (1) is there a global event of siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle to late Miocene; (2) what are the local and global mechanisms that controlled siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the Miocene.</div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 class="ltx_title_section">INTRODUCTION</h1><div>Continental margins represent a rich record of Earth history, the result and consequence of a myriad of processes and interactions that impact the continent-ocean intersection through geological time (e.g., fluvial and marine processes, biotic and more recently, human activity). According to the United Nations, 44% of the human population lives within 150 km of coastal areas, and are impacted by natural processes that occur at continental margins. Stratigraphic studies of the long-term Cenozoic evolution of continental margins can shed light on how future climate change will modify these environments. In terms of energy exploration, 17% of world’s petroleum reserves are located in middle and upper Miocene deposits that represent only 2% of the Phanerozoic <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The events and processes that have affected these areas in the past can be comprehended by the detailed examination of continental margin stratigraphy and geomorphology, both to elucidate past landscape evolution and predict that of the future. For example, the climatic and tectonic activity can be deciphered by identifying the signals left by these events in the strata preserved in continental margins. However, in order to understand the origins of the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins, it is essential to decipher the relative roles of local/regional causes vs. global causes. Although global processes (e.g., climate, eustatic changes) are directly linked to stratigraphic and basin evolution, modern research on continental margins is revealing that local conditions may overcome global signals, obscuring the impact of global events. Therefore, stratigraphic correlation between widely separated continental margins is not straightforward, since local conditions (e.g., subsidence pattern and sediment supply) influence stratigraphic architectures.</div><div></div><div>In that context, the Neogene period is marked by dramatic changes in climate and tectonic patterns (e.g., Tibetan Plateau uplift, development of the Antarctic ice sheet), that affected sea level and sediment supply rates and, consequently, continental margin evolution. A general trend of increasing terrestrial sedimentation rates is observed throughout the Cenozoic on many different margins&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Molnar_2004}</cite>. Particularly, in the Neogene, an increase in siliciclastic supply has been linked to the establishment of a climatic cooling trend that began during the middle Miocene and intensified on the Pliocene and Quaternary <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>. Such cooling is hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems. An increase in aridity, therefore, resulted in increased sedimentation supply to margins. However, although this relationship has been observed in modern analogs and numerical models, a solid link between climatic events and sediment supply in the stratigraphic record of the Neogene has yet to be established.</div><div></div><div>Potter and Szatmari&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009,Potter_2015}</cite> suggest that both the increase in sedimentation rates and the alteration in climate patterns that developed during the Miocene are the result of global plate tectonic processes. Based on a qualitative review of tectonic events during the Miocene, the authors argue that the movement of the Antarctic continent towards the south pole, the establishment of six oceanic gateways, and anomalous activity in two mantle “superplumes” below the Pacific and African plates, led to an increase in ice sheet development, a reorganization in the global oceanic currents, and a peak in tectonic orogeny elsewhere, including in areas remote from the superplumes. The reorganization of oceanic currents led to the development of the Antarctic circumpolar current, which formed a barrier between cold Antarctic waters and warmer equatorial waters. This event modified climate globally and established a cooling trend after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Subsequently, ice-sheet development and an increase in aridity resulted in lower sea level, reduced vegetation cover, and increasing in erosion rates. Cooler temperatures also amplified the effects of normally weak Milankovitch cycles, increasing amplitudes and frequencies of continental ice-sheet expansion and contraction and of associated eustatic oscillations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Eyles_1996}</cite>. At the same time, new sedimentary source areas were formed by orogeny during the mid-Miocene also contributed to the increased rates of sediment supply rate to margins. These patterns are observed in the stratigraphic records on continental margins worldwide, with the development of progradational sets <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bartek_1991}</cite>, the shutdown of carbonate factories, development of karst features, the growth of incised fluvial channels, and dominance of high-frequency Milankovitch cycles. All of these sedimentary features represent the stratigraphic response to sea-level fall, with increasing sedimentation rates, and global cooling <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cathro_2003,Liu_2011,Sanchez_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The Middle-to-Late Miocene, after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, is a period of increasing sediment supply and global cooling.

The case of the Australian Northwest Shelf (Northern Carnarvon Basin) is particularly interesting, since the middle-to-late Miocene sandstones of the Bare Formation constitute a unique episode of siliciclastic sedimentation on a carbonate-dominated margin. The abrupt change in global δ<sup>18</sup>O (‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak coupled with increased orogeny make the mid-to-late Miocene an important focal point for constraining global vs. local effects on the stratigraphic record.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expedition 356 Indonesian Throughflow drilled and cored seven new sites of the Neogene of the Australia Northwest Shelf in 2015, describing for the first time, in high resolution, the Neogene strata in the margin. Additionally, IODP Expedition 369 Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics will be drilling six sites in the Western Margin and one site in the Southern Margin of Australia. Scientific objectives of these expeditions for the Miocene include: constrain effects of the climatic transition for the sedimentary evolution of the margin, and how it varies latitudinally (e.g. transition from cool-water carbonates to tropical carbonates); the onset of the Leeuwin current; onset of the Indonesian Throughflow current; effects of the Tasman passages’ opening and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway in the sedimentary evolution of the margin. Jointly, these research efforts represent an opportunity to investigate the variability of Neogene deposition along the Western Australian margins, its variation in siliciclastic content, and its adaptation to latitudinal changes, from 17S to 35S (i.e. climate effects). A coauthor of this study participated in Expedition 356 and the author will be participating in Expedition 369 in September of 2016.</div><div></div><div>This research proposal aims to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. There are numerous problems that needed to be addressed, including: Do we observe a global or local increase in the siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle Miocene? How do these different formations correlate in age and extension? Are local conditions deviating the characteristics of deposits from a possibly global pattern? In this proposal, three phases of the project are discretized and explained: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">AREA OF STUDY</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Western Continental Margin of Australia</h2><div>The study area comprises the Continental margin of Western Australia and can be divided into two main blocks: the Australian Northwest Shelf (NWS; and the Australian Southwest Shelf (SWS).</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Northwest Shelf and Northern Carnarvon Basin</h3><div>Formed as a rifted margin in the late Permian, during the initial breakup of eastern Gondwana &nbsp;(CITE). Two subsequent phases of tectonic extension shaped the modern character of the margin: in the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic; and in the Late Jurassic <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Driscoll_1998}</cite>, that culminated with the separation of India and Australia in the early Cretaceous (Heine and Müller, 2005). In the Late Miocene, the formation of the Timor-Banda Arc subduction zone in northern NWS resulted in plate reorganization, with inversion of extensional faults <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cathro_2003}</cite>. Oceanographically, NWS is affected by the South Equatorial Current in the north, and by the shallow Leeuwin Current (Gallagher et al., 2017). The onset of Leeuwin is not fully constrained, with estimates ranging from Late Eocene (McGowran et al., 1997) to 500 ka (Kendrick et al., 1991). Modern studies, however, are converging to a Late Miocene-Pliocene age of initiation of the Leeuwin current (Sinha et al., 2006; Karas et al., 2011).</div><div></div><div>Mesozoic northward movement of the Australian tectonic plate into tropical latitudes is synchronous with a transition from siliciclastic to carbonate deposition on the margin (Veevers et al., 1991; Müller et al., 2008a). Carbonate deposition from the Eocene to late Miocene comprise calcilutites on the slope, calcisiltites and calcarenites near clinoform rollovers, and calcarenites on paleoshelves (Hull and Griffiths, 2002; Moss et al., 2004). Reefs or reef mounds occur in the Oligocene–Miocene section (Romine et al., 1997; Cathro et al., 2003; Ryan et al., 2009;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Liu_2011}</cite>. Cenozoic sedimentation is continuous along the NWS (Apthorpe, 1988), not restricted by Mesozoic basins and sub-basins.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Southwest Margin and Mentelle Basin</h3><div>The southwest margin of Australia consists of the Perth and Mentelle basins, as well as the Wallaby and Naturaliste plateaus (Bradshaw et al., 2003; Norvick, 2004). The Mentelle Basin is divided into eastern and western sub-basins (Bradshaw et al., 2003; Borissova et al., 2010), and is separated to the Perth basin by the structural high of the Yallingup Shelf. Paleozoic to Mesozoic development of SWS was controlled by multiple rifting phases in early Cretaceous that resulted in the break-up of eastern Gondwana (Bradshaw et al., 2003; Norvick, 2004). Miocene tectonic inversion is also observed across the SWS, with minor volcanic activity in the Houtman sub-basin (Daniell et al., 2010; Rollet et al., 2013a). DSDP 258 drilled the only stratigraphic well in the Mentelle Basin, containing the upper part of the post-rift succession to mid-Albian interval (Davies et al, 1974). Cenozoic strata of the Mentelle Basin are not understood. The condensed and discontinuous character of the section makes it difficult to differentiate and correlate (Bradshaw et al., 2003). DSDP 264, observed three Cenozoic units separated by unconformities: a middle Paleocene-lower Eocene chalk; an upper Eocene ooze; and an upper Miocene-Holocene ooze (Davies et al, 1974).</div><div></div><div>Data area is located in the Mentelle Basin and Naturaliste Plateau, in the southernmost portion of SWS (Figure 1). Targeted sites will allow comparison of deep water (site 8A) and intermediate water (site 9A) locations. Drilling is expected to recover continuous sequences of Paleocene–Eocene and Upper Miocene–Recent sequences strata. Particularly, sites MBAS-6A, MBAS-8A, and MBAS-9A are planned to recover Neogene sediments.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE</h1><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">I. Middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf: origins and potential links to global events</h2><div></div><div>The Bare Formation in the Northern Carnarvon Basin represents a unique episode of siliciclastic deposition within a carbonate-dominated system in the middle to late Miocene of the NWS, a period when anomalous tectonic and climatic activity led to an abrupt increase in continental-margin sedimentation worldwide. The Bare Fm. has been previously identified in the Dampier sub-basin, Beagle sub-basin, and Rankin platform, in the southeastern portion of NCB <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sanchez_2012a}</cite>. Recent drilling by IODP Expedition 356 recovered a&nbsp;partially continuous record of Neogene carbonate deposition (packstones, wackestone, and grainstones), in an overall shallow environment that is only interrupted by the presence of siliciclastic deposition of the Bare Fm. during the Late Miocene (Figure 2). Presence anhydrite coeval with siliciclastic deposition indicates it was deposited during a period of regional aridity and low relative sea level. Site U1462 represents the most detailed description of the carbonate and siliciclastic deposits of the Neogene of the NCB, that drilled and cored a depth below seafloor (CSF) of 946.09 m. Lithologically, site U1462C described medium to coarse quartz-sandstone, interbedded with calcarenite and dolomite.</div><div></div><div>In light of new information and interpretations developed by IODP 356 research team, our objective is to reinterpreted the stratigraphy, the depositional system, and timing of deposition of the Bare Fm., in the context of regional climatic and tectonics events of NWS.</div><div></div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Data</h3><div>Data area is located at the Dampier sub-basin, where the thickest package of the Bare Fm. develops (Figure 1). Lithostratigraphy of Site U1462 is divided into four units (Figure 5). Lithologic descriptions are based on sediments recovered from Holes U1462A (0–849.6 m core depth below seafloor [CSF-A]), U1462B (0–47.8 m CSF-A), and U1462C (33–946.09 m CSF-A). The holes were aligned based on drilling depth and correlation of lithologic boundaries (Gallagher et al., 2017). Nannofossil analyses were done at 10 m resolution and additional benthic foraminiferal samples were taken from selected intervals, to define paleobathymetry and biostratigraphic age (Gallagher et al., 2017). In this work, we coupled the new lithological descriptions and biostratigraphic dating provided by IODP Exp 356 with 2D and 3D seismic stratigraphy analysis. Seismic data include a set of 3D MCS surveys, with a total area of 8000 km2, and a dense 2D seismic data grid with a total area of 29460 km2. Central frequencies for the MCS data range from 32 to 50 Hz, with a vertical resolution of around 15 m in the study interval (velocity of 2000 m/s). Seismic-well tie is performed using FMS-sonic and VSI (versatile seismic image) p-wave velocity logs from U1462C. 3D and 2D MCS data were donated to the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) by Woodside Petroleum, Ltd. and Geoscience Australia.</div><div></div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Hypothesis</h3><ul><li>Depositional System of the Bare Fm: Deltaic vs. Beach-barrier environment.</li></ul><div>Using seismic interpretation, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sanchez_2012,Sanchez_2012a}</cite> identified 27 delta lobes and suggested that siliciclastic deposition of the Bare Fm. occurred as a deltaic progradation over the carbonate-dominated shelf during sea-level fall in the Late Miocene. A deltaic interpretation for the Bare Fm. implies a major change of climate conditions in the hinterland in a short period of time, that affected run-off activity and delta progradation. Alternatively, Smith et al. (2014) O’Callaghan et al. (2014) and Griben et al. (2016), argued that the absence of recognizable fluvial channels in 3D seismic data, the along-strike orientation of the deposits, and the interpretation of regional geology advocate for a beach-barrier depositional system. Our analysis intends to untie the present duality in the interpretation of the depositional system. 3D Seismic stratigraphy and coherence attribute analysis is performed in order to identify singular features that may allow us to differentiate between the two interpretations. For example, at the resolution of the seismic survey, we expect to observe fluvial channels, channel belts, and deltaic forms, what would support a deltaic interpretation. Considering the large volume of siliciclastic sedimentation, fluvial channel incisions, and channel filling, should also be observed. On the other hand, apresence of lateral accretion and beachlines, with a predominantly along-strike morphology for the deposits would favors a beach-barrier interpretation.</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>The Bare Fm. represents a stratigraphic response to environmental changes in the climate and oceanographic system of the NWS.</li></ul><div>Siliciclastic deposition over the NWS carbonate margin has been previously connected to climatic transition in continental Australia (Groneveld et al., 2017; Christensen et al., 2017). Specifically, variability of quartz content (%) throughout the Cenozoic may reflects transition between arid and wet periods in NW Australia regional climate cells. The connection is that an increase in humidity in a previously arid environment intensifies runoff processes, and subsequently, fluvial transport of siliciclastic sediments to the margins. On the other hand, sedimentary processes on the coast are also affected by longshore processes and wave action. Volume of sediment reworking in the shelf could be either strengthened or weakened, depending on the intensity of coastal processes. Neogene oceanographic events on the NWS include the constraining of the Indonesian gateway and the establishment of the deep and cold Indonesian Throughflow current; the onset of the shallow and ward Leeuwin current; the transition from cold-water carbonate factories to tropical factories. We will test if the Bare Fm. correspond to the stratigraphic component of environmental reorganization of the NWS in the Neogene, correlating timing and concentration of siliciclastic deposition with timing of Neogene changes in regional climate and oceanography. Additionally, we expect to observe singular stratigraphic features within the Bare Fm. that are connected to those regional transitions. For example, presence of karstification and sinkhole are associated with subaerial exposure of the shelf during sea-level falls, and has been associated with falling stage system tracts (FSTT; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Raine_2017}</cite> .</div><div></div><ul><li>Sedimentary strata deposited during the middle-to-late Miocene in global continental margins are strongly linked, representing the global mid-Miocene siliciclastic influx event.</li></ul><div>A similarity between the sedimentary processes that affected different continental margins between the Middle Miocene to Late Miocene would suggest a connection between these events. The proposed global mid-Miocene siliciclastic influx will be verified if the different siliciclastic formations observed in continental margins are equivalent in lithostratigraphy, timing of deposition and sediment volume.</div><div></div><ul><li>The mid-Miocene siliclastic influx is a stratigraphic response to the global Miocene climatic transition.</li></ul><div>If biostratigraphic ages and depositional conditions of siliciclastic influxes across continental margins are synchronized, occurring globally in a short period of time, the idea of an allochthones, global cause is reinforced, since it affects all continental margins equally, and at the same time. On the other hand, a larger variability in depositional systems and timing of deposition, may indicate a disconnection between these sedimentary processes, reinforcing the importance of local/regional processes affecting the continental margin stratigraphy.</div><div></div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">II. Exp 356 and 369 Transect: Neogene Paleoclimate variation along Western Australia.</h2><div></div><div><div>IODP Exp 356 exposed the latitudinal control on Neogene deposits of NWS. It observed two distinct group of lithologies, one in sites U1458 and U1459, and the second from U1461 to U1464. It also identified a progressive depositional trend between U1461 and U1464, from arid to wetter depositional conditions (Gallagher et al., 2017; Christensen et al., 2017). Those trends reflect climatic variability along latitudes. In that way, northern sites tend to reflect more tropical characteristics whether southern sites display more arid evidences. Oceanographic divides between oceanic currents are also manifested on a latitudinal transect.</div><div></div><div>Additionally, it is important to consider the impacts of continental drift and dynamic topography in driving depositional changes during the Neogene of Western Australia. Northward drift of Australia brought NWS into tropical latitudes (Veevers et al., 1991; Muller et al., 2008a), that resulted in a depositional transition from siliciclastic to carbonate deposition on the NWS (Gallagher et al., 2017). Dynamic topography models indicate that the western Australia underwent through an intensification of a tilting processes during the Cenozoic. As the continent moved away from a mantle anomaly, and the Banda Arc subduction zone is established in the north, at least 100 m of vertical space was created at the NWS due to continental tilt, causing an increase in accommodation space and the consequent inundation of the NWS <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{DiCaprio_2009,DiCaprio_2011}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Fluctuating siliciclastic content throughout the Neogene carbonate section cored by Expedition 356 has provided crucial information on the evolution of aridity in northwestern Australia and the development of the Australian Monsoon. IODP Exp 369 will allow us to further extend the latitudinal transect, englobing the entire Western Margin (Figure 1). The transect will represent a complete sequence of Neogene sites from temperate, cool-water areas, to tropical, warm-areas.</div><div></div><div>{Data}

However, it also intensifies carbonate production, and so the siliciclastic signal may not be clear. At the same time, differential subsidence should be less pronounce in SWS, so we expected a more condensed section for Cenozoic sedimentation. Exp 356 results suggest that west Australia became wetter during the late Miocene creating a climate gradient with the arid interior, while northwest Australia remained arid throughout (Groneveld et al., 2017). That should also be reflected in Qz% and K% in SWS.</div><div><div></div><div></div></div><div></div>
