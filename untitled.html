<h1 id="auto-label-section-181311" class="ltx_title_section">PROPOSAL SUMMARY </h1><div></div><div>The Neogene is a period when the Earth underwent through drastic modifications in the processes that ultimately control the evolution of sedimentary systems: climate and tectonics. It is in the Neogene that Earth’s continental plates acquired its modern shape, modifying sea level and patterns of oceanic currents that intensified ongoing climatic changes. At the same time, a pulse in tectonic activity generated new orogenic areas, increasing the availability of source rocks. Sedimentary systems, as a secondary process in Earth’s system, respond promptly to the reorganization of the primary forces, and hence, the signals of the Neogene events are recorded in the stratigraphic record of continental margins.</div><div></div><div>Particularly, influxes of siliciclastic sediment in global continental margins have been observed in the middle-to-late Miocene period&nbsp;(Lavier 2001, Steckler 1999, Sanchez 2012, Tcherepanov 2010, Lu 2004). An increase in orogeny, and an abrupt change in global δ18O(‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak&nbsp;are also documented for this 10 Ma interval&nbsp;(Potter et al., 2009; Potter et al., 2015). Cooler temperatures are hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expeditions 356 - Indonesian Throughflow and 369 - Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics are recovering Neogene strata in the Western Continental Margin of Australia, representing a latitudinal transect of cores from 17S to 35S, fully comprehending the Western Australian Margin. This research proposal is developed within the major objectives of Expeditions 356 and 369, and intends to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. The project is split depending on the focus area, and the main methodology used (seismic stratigraphy; core and log correlation; numerical modeling). A three-step research approach is proposed: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div>The project will test several individual hypotheses (see proposal in detail), clarifying local and regional problems, but ultimately, we intend to contribute to two main scientific problems: (1) is there a global event of siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle to late Miocene; (2) what are the local and global mechanisms that controlled siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the Miocene.</div><div></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-598337" class="ltx_title_section">INTRODUCTION</h1><div>Continental margins represent a rich record of Earth history, the result and consequence of a myriad of processes and interactions that impact the continent-ocean intersection through geological time (e.g., fluvial and marine processes, biotic and more recently, human activity). According to the United Nations, 44% of the human population lives within 150 km of coastal areas, and are impacted by natural processes that occur at continental margins. Stratigraphic studies of the long-term Cenozoic evolution of continental margins can shed light on how future climate change will modify these environments. In terms of energy exploration, 17% of world’s petroleum reserves are located in middle and upper Miocene deposits that represent only 2% of the Phanerozoic <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The events and processes that have affected these areas in the past can be comprehended by the detailed examination of continental margin stratigraphy and geomorphology, both to elucidate past landscape evolution and predict that of the future. For example, the climatic and tectonic activity can be deciphered by identifying the signals left by these events in the strata preserved in continental margins. However, in order to understand the origins of the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins, it is essential to decipher the relative roles of local/regional causes vs. global causes. Although global processes (e.g., climate, eustatic changes) are directly linked to stratigraphic and basin evolution, modern research on continental margins is revealing that local conditions may overcome global signals, obscuring the impact of global events. Therefore, stratigraphic correlation between widely separated continental margins is not straightforward, since local conditions (e.g., subsidence pattern and sediment supply) influence stratigraphic architectures.</div><div></div><div>In that context, the Neogene period is marked by dramatic changes in climate and tectonic patterns (e.g., Tibetan Plateau uplift, development of the Antarctic ice sheet), that affected sea level and sediment supply rates and, consequently, continental margin evolution. A general trend of increasing terrestrial sedimentation rates is observed throughout the Cenozoic on many different margins&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Molnar_2004}</cite>. Particularly, in the Neogene, an increase in siliciclastic supply has been linked to the establishment of a climatic cooling trend that began during the middle Miocene and intensified on the Pliocene and Quaternary <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>. Such cooling is hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems. An increase in aridity, therefore, resulted in increased sedimentation supply to margins. However, although this relationship has been observed in modern analogs and numerical models, a solid link between climatic events and sediment supply in the stratigraphic record of the Neogene has yet to be established.</div><div></div><div>Potter and Szatmari&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009,Potter_2015}</cite> suggest that both the increase in sedimentation rates and the alteration in climate patterns that developed during the Miocene are the result of global plate tectonic processes. Based on a qualitative review of tectonic events during the Miocene, the authors argue that the movement of the Antarctic continent towards the south pole, the establishment of six oceanic gateways, and anomalous activity in two mantle “superplumes” below the Pacific and African plates, led to an increase in ice sheet development, a reorganization in the global oceanic currents, and a peak in tectonic orogeny elsewhere, including in areas remote from the superplumes. The reorganization of oceanic currents led to the development of the Antarctic circumpolar current, which formed a barrier between cold Antarctic waters and warmer equatorial waters. This event modified climate globally and established a cooling trend after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Subsequently, ice-sheet development and an increase in aridity resulted in lower sea level, reduced vegetation cover, and increasing in erosion rates. Cooler temperatures also amplified the effects of normally weak Milankovitch cycles, increasing amplitudes and frequencies of continental ice-sheet expansion and contraction and of associated eustatic oscillations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Eyles_1996}</cite>. At the same time, new sedimentary source areas were formed by orogeny during the mid-Miocene also contributed to the increased rates of sediment supply rate to margins. These patterns are observed in the stratigraphic records on continental margins worldwide, with the development of progradational sets <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bartek_1991}</cite>, the shutdown of carbonate factories, development of karst features, the growth of incised fluvial channels, and dominance of high-frequency Milankovitch cycles. All of these sedimentary features represent the stratigraphic response to sea-level fall, with increasing sedimentation rates, and global cooling <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cathro_2003,Liu_2011,Sanchez_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The Middle-to-Late Miocene, after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, is a period of increasing sediment supply and global cooling. Influxes of siliciclastic sediment during this period have been observed on the New Jersey margin (<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/146093/articles/157927-seismic-interpretation-and-forward-stratigraphic-modeling-study-of-neogene-sequences-on-continental-margins-western-australian-margin#Steckler_1999">Steckler 1999</a>), in the Gulf of Mexico <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galloway_2008,Galloway_2011}</cite>, in the Mediterranean&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{John_2003}</cite>, on the West African margin <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/146093/articles/157927-seismic-interpretation-and-forward-stratigraphic-modeling-study-of-neogene-sequences-on-continental-margins-western-australian-margin#Lavier_2001">(Lavier 2001</a>), Australian margin&nbsp;<a href="#Lavier_2001">(</a><a href="#Sanchez_2012">Sanchez 2012,</a> <a href="#Tcherepanov_2010">Tcherepanov 2010</a><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cathro_2003,Liu_2011,Sanchez_2012}</cite>, and off New Zealand <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lu_2004}</cite>. The case of the Australian Northwest Shelf (Northern Carnarvon Basin) is particularly interesting, since the middle-to-late Miocene sandstones of the Bare Formation constitute a unique episode of siliciclastic sedimentation on a carbonate-dominated margin. The abrupt change in global δ<sup>18</sup>O (‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak coupled with increased orogeny make the mid-to-late Miocene an important focal point for constraining global vs. local effects on the stratigraphic record.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expedition 356 Indonesian Throughflow drilled and cored seven new sites of the Neogene of the Australia Northwest Shelf in 2015, describing for the first time, in high resolution, the Neogene strata in the margin. Additionally, IODP Expedition 369 Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics will be drilling six sites in the Western Margin and one site in the Southern Margin of Australia. Scientific objectives of these expeditions for the Miocene include: constrain effects of the climatic transition for the sedimentary evolution of the margin, and how it varies latitudinally (e.g. transition from cool-water carbonates to tropical carbonates); the onset of the Leeuwin current; onset of the Indonesian Throughflow current; effects of the Tasman passages’ opening and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway in the sedimentary evolution of the margin. Jointly, these research efforts represent an opportunity to investigate the variability of Neogene deposition along the Western Australian margins, its variation in siliciclastic content, and its adaptation to latitudinal changes, from 17S to 35S (i.e. climate effects). A coauthor of this study participated in Expedition 356 and the author will be participating in Expedition 369 in September of 2016.</div><div></div><div>This research proposal aims to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. There are numerous problems that needed to be addressed, including: Do we observe a global or local increase in the siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle Miocene? How do these different formations correlate in age and extension? Are local conditions deviating the characteristics of deposits from a possibly global pattern? In this proposal, three phases of the project are discretized and explained: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Additionally, it is important to consider the impacts of continental drift and dynamic topography in driving depositional changes during the Neogene of Western Australia. Northward drift of Australia brought NWS into tropical latitudes (Veevers et al., 1991; Muller et al., 2008a), that resulted in a depositional transition from siliciclastic to carbonate deposition on the NWS (Gallagher et al., 2017). Dynamic topography models indicate that the western Australia underwent through an intensification of a tilting processes during the Cenozoic. As the continent moved away from a mantle anomaly, and the Banda Arc subduction zone is established in the north, at least 100 m of vertical space was created at the NWS due to continental tilt, causing an increase in accommodation space and the consequent inundation of the NWS <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{DiCaprio_2009,DiCaprio_2011}</cite>. Fluctuating siliciclastic content throughout the Neogene carbonate section cored by Expedition 356 has provided crucial information on the evolution of aridity in northwestern Australia and the development of the Australian Monsoon. IODP Exp 369 will allow us to further extend the latitudinal transect, englobing the entire Western Margin (Figure 1). The transect will represent a complete sequence of Neogene sites from temperate, cool-water areas, to tropical, warm-areas.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><div>Data</div></h3><div><div>Sites MBAS-6A, MBAS-8A and MBAS-9A are planned to recover Neogene sediments (Figure 1; Hobbs et al., 2016). Proceeding chapters of IODP 369 will include lithological descriptions, biostratigraphic ages. Logging tools include gamma ray, color reflectance, porosity, density, magnetic susceptibility, uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations.</div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div>Hypothesis</div><div><div><i><b>Exp 356 and 369 Transect: Neogene Paleoclimate variation along Western Australia.</b></i></div><div></div><div>The extended transect will allow us to further constrain the onset and development of the Leeuwin current and its effects on sedimentation, particularly the boundary between tropical/subtropical and temperate carbonate deposition. Moreover, differential subsidence between the transect limits is expected to be at least 100 m, &nbsp;have impacted accommodation space generation, and hence, sedimentary deposition, in the margin.&nbsp;Spectral gamma ray logs may prove to be particularly valuable for tracking the siliciclastic contribution, as they have been for Expedition 356 where they may allow the distinction of fluvial from aeolian contributions, thereby providing enhanced links between sedimentation and climate.&nbsp;</div></div><ul><li>What is the lithological heterogeneity along the transect? How siliciclastic varies along the margin?&nbsp;How differential subsidence along the margin affected siliciclastic distribution?</li></ul><div>The more tropical conditions in NWS than in SWS possibly intensify run-off activity, and subsequent, siliciclastic transport and deposition. However, it also intensifies carbonate production, and so the siliciclastic signal may not be clear. At the same time, differential subsidence should be less pronounce in SWS, so we expected a more condensed section for Cenozoic sedimentation. Exp 356 results suggest that west Australia became wetter during the late Miocene creating a climate gradient with the arid interior, while northwest Australia remained arid throughout (Groneveld et al., 2017). That should also be reflected in Qz% and K% in SWS.&nbsp;</div><div></div><ul><li>Cenozoic paleoceanography: how did oceanographic conditions at the Naturaliste Plateau change during the opening of the Tasman passages and restriction of the Indonesian gateway?</li></ul><div>Cenozoic and Neogene Regional sedimentation trends in Western Australia are strongly linked to the evolution of local oceanic currents (e.g. Leeuwin current and Indonesian Throughflow). The establishment of the Indonesian Gateway and the opening of the Tasman passage forced a reorganization of these currents. We expect to observe, in the stratigraphic record, the signals of these oceanic events. For example, IODP Exp 356 results, based on %K, &nbsp;suggested that the constriction of the Indonesian Throughflow current during the Late Neogene (5.5 Ma - 3.3 Ma) transferred control of the northwest Australian climate from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, resulting in an increase of aridity in the margin (Christensen et al., 2017). A diffuse propagation of these effects to the southern margin is expected. current caries along the margin, Furthermore, the transect emcompass virtually the entire area affected by the Leeuwin current. We will be able to address, based on the stratigraphic signals, major changes in the current's characteristics (i.e., change from warm water to cool water deposition).</div><div></div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">III. A Coupled Stratigraphic - Landscape Evolution Model of SW Australian Continental Margin: climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</h1><div></div><div>The recent advance in computational techniques allowed the development of new quantitative methods in geosciences. For the first time, it is possible to simulate synthetically the geological processes in its original scales in space and time (e.g. millions of years, hundreds of kilometers). Many modeling techniques in earth surface processes have been developed in the recent time, including notably, the efforts of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS), a hub of development and distribution of open-source&nbsp;scientific programs to simulate Earth's processes, with diverse purposes and programming languages. In sedimentary systems, modeling development has been concentrated on landscape evolution models (i.e. erosion and transport processes), with a focus on modern systems and future predictions. Given the relative short scale of modern environments, tectonic and stratigraphic processes are often neglected in landscape evolution models.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>At the same time, stratigraphic studies are limited by the degree of uncertainty of stratigraphic interpretations, that often enables more than one possible outcomes of stratigraphic analysis. For that reason, an attempt to enhance descriptions and further limit the degree of interpretation is currently in place by the scientific community. This is particularly clear in the sequence stratigraphy community, attempting to standardize its concepts and ideas to produce more consistent results&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Catuneanu_2009}</cite>.  Recent advances in modeling of passive continental margins include <i>SEDSIM, SedFlux&nbsp;</i>and <i>Dionisos </i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Csato_2014,Griffiths_2001,Hutton_2008}</cite>. Therefore, stratigraphic studies would greatly benefit by the development and application of numerical models.</div><div></div><div>In this context, SIGNUM (Simple Integrated Geomorphological Numerical Model) is a Matlab, TIN-based landscape evolution model, that simulates landscape evolution in different scales. &nbsp;It uses an explicit finite-volume scheme that requires a CFL upper limit for the time step <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Refice_2012}</cite>. Particularly, it is capable of simulating hillslope processes such as linear and nonlinear diffusion, fluvial incision into bedrock, spatially varying surface uplift which can be used to simulate changes in base level, thrust and faulting, as well as effects of climate changes, using three main equations <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Refice_2012}</cite>:</div><ol><li>Stream Power Equation: <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{∂z}{∂t}=-K_cA^m(∇z)^n\)</span>, represents the rate of&nbsp;fluvial incision as a power law function of water discharge and local channel gradient.

It uses a elastoviscoplastic approach (EVP) that allows it to simulate tectonic deformation, lithospheric flexure, &nbsp;and rheological models for the flow of rocks&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Choi_2013}</cite>. By solving the momentum balance and heat equation in Lagrangian form, it has been successfully used to model mid-ocean ridge initiation, normal fault evolution, and&nbsp;glacier and ice

Coupling landscape evolution models with tectonic and stratigraphic models constitute an opportunity to simulate the interactions and feedback between local and regional controls to the development of continental margins.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Hypothesis</h3><div></div><ul><li>Tilting of Australian Continent after Late Cretaceous, and its effects on the margin evolution.</li></ul><div>Dicaprio et al. (2009, 2015) proposed a long and continuous northward tilting of Australian continent after Late Cretaceous, and a consequent inundation of the &nbsp;northern margin. At least 100 m of gradient in elevation is expected between NWS and SWS, as a result of Cenozoic tilting. A concomitantly gradual and continuous shift of erosion and sedimentation processes towards north, as a response to accommodation space generation, is also anticipated.</div><div></div><ul><li>Feedbacks and interactions of intraplate stress and climate driving landscape evolution.</li></ul><div>Neogene record of the West African margin shows a pulse of terrigenous sedimentation during the Miocene, that is also concomitantly with tectonic reactivation of the margin that caused the uplift of &nbsp;at least 500 m and consequent erosion of the shelf <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lavier_2001}</cite>. The same period, globally, is marked by a greenhouse-icehouse transition, with a drastic change in&nbsp;δ<sup>18</sup>O
(‰) values, and sea level fall. Therefore, in that case, both tectonic and climatic processes caused a pulse in terrigenous deposition in the margin (i.e. progradation and shelf erosion), although the increase in sedimentation off Angola seems to be dominated by the effect of global cooling, as it correlates with the middle Miocene d δ<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;shift. NWS of Australia present a similar behavior of tectonic reactivation and increase in terrigenous sedimentation during the middle Miocene. Our goal is to constrain the mechanisms driving the increase in terrigenous sedimentation.&nbsp;For example, I will address how tectonic uplift/subsidence/intra-plate stress and climate affect erosion rates and, as a result, the amount of sediment transported to the margin.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
