<h1 id="auto-label-section-181311" class="ltx_title_section">PROPOSAL SUMMARY </h1><div></div><div>The Neogene is a period when the Earth underwent through drastic modifications in the processes that ultimately control the evolution of sedimentary systems: climate and tectonics. It is in the Neogene that Earth’s continental plates acquired its modern shape, modifying sea level and patterns of oceanic currents that intensified ongoing climatic changes. At the same time, a pulse in tectonic activity generated new orogenic areas, increasing the availability of source rocks. Sedimentary systems, as a secondary process in Earth’s system, respond promptly to the reorganization of the primary forces, and hence, the signals of the Neogene events are recorded in the stratigraphic record of continental margins.</div><div></div><div>Particularly, influxes of siliciclastic sediment in global continental margins have been observed in the middle-to-late Miocene period&nbsp;(Lavier 2001, Steckler 1999, Sanchez 2012, Tcherepanov 2010, Lu 2004). An increase in orogeny, and an abrupt change in global δ18O(‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak&nbsp;are also documented for this 10 Ma interval&nbsp;(Potter et al., 2009; Potter et al., 2015). Cooler temperatures are hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expeditions 356 - Indonesian Throughflow and 369 - Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics are recovering Neogene strata in the Western Continental Margin of Australia, representing a latitudinal transect of cores from 17S to 35S, fully comprehending the Western Australian Margin. This research proposal is developed within the major objectives of Expeditions 356 and 369, and intends to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. The project is split depending on the focus area, and the main methodology used (seismic stratigraphy; core and log correlation; numerical modeling). A three-step research approach is proposed: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div>The project will test several individual hypotheses (see proposal in detail), clarifying local and regional problems, but ultimately, we intend to contribute to two main scientific problems: (1) is there a global event of siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle to late Miocene; (2) what are the local and global mechanisms that controlled siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the Miocene.</div><div></div><div>INTRODUCTION</div><div>Continental margins represent a rich record of Earth history, the result and consequence of a myriad of processes and interactions that impact the continent-ocean intersection through geological time (e.g., fluvial and marine processes, biotic and more recently, human activity). According to the United Nations, 44% of the human population lives within 150 km of coastal areas, and are impacted by natural processes that occur at continental margins. Stratigraphic studies of the long-term Cenozoic evolution of continental margins can shed light on how future climate change will modify these environments. In terms of energy exploration, 17% of world’s petroleum reserves are located in middle and upper Miocene deposits that represent only 2% of the Phanerozoic <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The events and processes that have affected these areas in the past can be comprehended by the detailed examination of continental margin stratigraphy and geomorphology, both to elucidate past landscape evolution and predict that of the future. For example, the climatic and tectonic activity can be deciphered by identifying the signals left by these events in the strata preserved in continental margins. However, in order to understand the origins of the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins, it is essential to decipher the relative roles of local/regional causes vs. global causes. Although global processes (e.g., climate, eustatic changes) are directly linked to stratigraphic and basin evolution, modern research on continental margins is revealing that local conditions may overcome global signals, obscuring the impact of global events. Therefore, stratigraphic correlation between widely separated continental margins is not straightforward, since local conditions (e.g., subsidence pattern and sediment supply) influence stratigraphic architectures.</div><div></div><div>In that context, the Neogene period is marked by dramatic changes in climate and tectonic patterns (e.g., Tibetan Plateau uplift, development of the Antarctic ice sheet), that affected sea level and sediment supply rates and, consequently, continental margin evolution. A general trend of increasing terrestrial sedimentation rates is observed throughout the Cenozoic on many different margins&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Molnar_2004}</cite>. Particularly, in the Neogene, an increase in siliciclastic supply has been linked to the establishment of a climatic cooling trend that began during the middle Miocene and intensified on the Pliocene and Quaternary <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>. Such cooling is hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems. An increase in aridity, therefore, resulted in increased sedimentation supply to margins. However, although this relationship has been observed in modern analogs and numerical models, a solid link between climatic events and sediment supply in the stratigraphic record of the Neogene has yet to be established.</div><div></div><div>Potter and Szatmari&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009,Potter_2015}</cite> suggest that both the increase in sedimentation rates and the alteration in climate patterns that developed during the Miocene are the result of global plate tectonic processes. Based on a qualitative review of tectonic events during the Miocene, the authors argue that the movement of the Antarctic continent towards the south pole, the establishment of six oceanic gateways, and anomalous activity in two mantle “superplumes” below the Pacific and African plates, led to an increase in ice sheet development, a reorganization in the global oceanic currents, and a peak in tectonic orogeny elsewhere, including in areas remote from the superplumes. The reorganization of oceanic currents led to the development of the Antarctic circumpolar current, which formed a barrier between cold Antarctic waters and warmer equatorial waters. This event modified climate globally and established a cooling trend after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Subsequently, ice-sheet development and an increase in aridity resulted in lower sea level, reduced vegetation cover, and increasing in erosion rates. Cooler temperatures also amplified the effects of normally weak Milankovitch cycles, increasing amplitudes and frequencies of continental ice-sheet expansion and contraction and of associated eustatic oscillations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Eyles_1996}</cite>. At the same time, new sedimentary source areas were formed by orogeny during the mid-Miocene also contributed to the increased rates of sediment supply rate to margins. These patterns are observed in the stratigraphic records on continental margins worldwide, with the development of progradational sets <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bartek_1991}</cite>, the shutdown of carbonate factories, development of karst features, the growth of incised fluvial channels, and dominance of high-frequency Milankovitch cycles. All of these sedimentary features represent the stratigraphic response to sea-level fall, with increasing sedimentation rates, and global cooling <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cathro_2003,Liu_2011,Sanchez_2012}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The Middle-to-Late Miocene, after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum, is a period of increasing sediment supply and global cooling. Influxes of siliciclastic sediment during this period have been observed on the New Jersey margin (<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/146093/articles/157927-seismic-interpretation-and-forward-stratigraphic-modeling-study-of-neogene-sequences-on-continental-margins-western-australian-margin#Steckler_1999">Steckler 1999</a>), in the Gulf of Mexico <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galloway_2008,Galloway_2011}</cite>, in the Mediterranean&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{John_2003}</cite>, on the West African margin <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/146093/articles/157927-seismic-interpretation-and-forward-stratigraphic-modeling-study-of-neogene-sequences-on-continental-margins-western-australian-margin#Lavier_2001">(Lavier 2001</a>), Australian margin&nbsp;<a href="#Lavier_2001">(</a><a href="#Sanchez_2012">Sanchez 2012,</a> <a href="#Tcherepanov_2010">Tcherepanov 2010</a><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cathro_2003,Liu_2011,Sanchez_2012}</cite>, and off New Zealand <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lu_2004}</cite>. The case of the Australian Northwest Shelf (Northern Carnarvon Basin) is particularly interesting, since the middle-to-late Miocene sandstones of the Bare Formation constitute a unique episode of siliciclastic sedimentation on a carbonate-dominated margin. The abrupt change in global δ<sup>18</sup>O (‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak coupled with increased orogeny make the mid-to-late Miocene an important focal point for constraining global vs. local effects on the stratigraphic record.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expedition 356 Indonesian Throughflow drilled and cored seven new sites of the Neogene of the Australia Northwest Shelf in 2015, describing for the first time, in high resolution, the Neogene strata in the margin. Additionally, IODP Expedition 369 Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics will be drilling six sites in the Western Margin and one site in the Southern Margin of Australia. Scientific objectives of these expeditions for the Miocene include: constrain effects of the climatic transition for the sedimentary evolution of the margin, and how it varies latitudinally (e.g. transition from cool-water carbonates to tropical carbonates); the onset of the Leeuwin current; onset of the Indonesian Throughflow current; effects of the Tasman passages’ opening and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway in the sedimentary evolution of the margin. Jointly, these research efforts represent an opportunity to investigate the variability of Neogene deposition along the Western Australian margins, its variation in siliciclastic content, and its adaptation to latitudinal changes, from 17S to 35S (i.e. climate effects). A coauthor of this study participated in Expedition 356 and the author will be participating in Expedition 369 in September of 2016.</div><div></div><div>This research proposal aims to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. There are numerous problems that needed to be addressed, including: Do we observe a global or local increase in the siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle Miocene? How do these different formations correlate in age and extension? Are local conditions deviating the characteristics of deposits from a possibly global pattern? In this proposal, three phases of the project are discretized and explained: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div>
