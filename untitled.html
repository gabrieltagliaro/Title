<h1 id="auto-label-section-181311" class="ltx_title_section">PROPOSAL SUMMARY </h1><div></div><div>The Neogene is a period when the Earth underwent through drastic modifications in the processes that ultimately control the evolution of sedimentary systems: climate and tectonics. It is in the Neogene that Earth’s continental plates acquired its modern shape, modifying sea level and patterns of oceanic currents that intensified ongoing climatic changes. At the same time, a pulse in tectonic activity generated new orogenic areas, increasing the availability of source rocks. Sedimentary systems, as a secondary process in Earth’s system, respond promptly to the reorganization of the primary forces, and hence, the signals of the Neogene events are recorded in the stratigraphic record of continental margins.</div><div></div><div>Particularly, influxes of siliciclastic sediment in global continental margins have been observed in the middle-to-late Miocene period&nbsp;(Lavier 2001, Steckler 1999, Sanchez 2012, Tcherepanov 2010, Lu 2004). An increase in orogeny, and an abrupt change in global δ18O(‰) isotope values after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum peak&nbsp;are also documented for this 10 Ma interval&nbsp;(Potter et al., 2009; Potter et al., 2015). Cooler temperatures are hypothesized to have led to a decrease in precipitation rates, reducing vegetation cover in sediment source areas and resulting in more efficient erosion and transport of sediment by fluvial systems.</div><div></div><div>IODP Expeditions 356 - Indonesian Throughflow and 369 - Australia Cretaceous Climate and Tectonics are recovering Neogene strata in the Western Continental Margin of Australia, representing a latitudinal transect of cores from 17S to 35S, fully comprehending the Western Australian Margin. This research proposal is developed within the major objectives of Expeditions 356 and 369, and intends to analyze the stratigraphic evolution of continental margins during the Neogene, its interactions and feedbacks with climatic and oceanographic events. Specifically, we focus on siliciclastic deposition during the middle to late Miocene in Western Australia continental margin. The project is split depending on the focus area, and the main methodology used (seismic stratigraphy; core and log correlation; numerical modeling). A three-step research approach is proposed: (1) middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf - origins and potential links to global events; (2) Expedition 356 and 369 transect - Neogene paleoclimate variation along Western Australia; (3) a coupled stratigraphic - landscape evolution model of SW Australian continental margin - climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</div><div></div><div>The project will test several individual hypotheses (see proposal in detail), clarifying local and regional problems, but ultimately, we intend to contribute to two main scientific problems: (1) is there a global event of siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the middle to late Miocene; (2) what are the local and global mechanisms that controlled siliciclastic deposition in continental margins during the Miocene.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
