The establishment of the Indonesian Gateway and the opening of the Tasman passage forced a reorganization of these currents. We expect to observe, in the stratigraphic record, the signals of these oceanic events. For example, IODP Exp 356 results, based on %K, &nbsp;suggested that the constriction of the Indonesian Throughflow current during the Late Neogene (5.5 Ma - 3.3 Ma) transferred control of the northwest Australian climate from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, resulting in an increase of aridity in the margin (Christensen et al., 2017). A diffuse propagation of these effects to the southern margin is expected. current caries along the margin, Furthermore, the transect emcompass virtually the entire area affected by the Leeuwin current. We will be able to address, based on the stratigraphic signals, major changes in the current's characteristics (i.e., change from warm water to cool water deposition).</div><div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">III. A Coupled Stratigraphic - Landscape Evolution Model of SW Australian Continental Margin: climate-tectonic interactions in the Neogene.</h1><div></div><div>The recent advance in computational techniques allowed the development of new quantitative methods in geosciences. For the first time, it is possible to simulate synthetically the geological processes in its original scales in space and time (e.g. millions of years, hundreds of kilometers). Many modeling techniques in earth surface processes have been developed in the recent time, including notably, the efforts of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS), a hub of development and distribution of open-source&nbsp;scientific programs to simulate Earth's processes, with diverse purposes and programming languages. In sedimentary systems, modeling development has been concentrated on landscape evolution models (i.e. erosion and transport processes), with a focus on modern systems and future predictions. Given the relative short scale of modern environments, tectonic and stratigraphic processes are often neglected in landscape evolution models.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>At the same time, stratigraphic studies are limited by the degree of uncertainty of stratigraphic interpretations, that often enables more than one possible outcomes of stratigraphic analysis.

Middle-late Miocene siliciclastic influx on the Australian Northwest Shelf: origins and potential links to global events</h2><div></div><div>Seismically, the Bare Fm. is characterized by a large amplitude, and partially discontinuous set of seismic reflectors immersed in an overall continuous and homogeneous set of seismic reflectors that constitute the carbonates of Trealla Formation (Figure 4). Maximum seismic thickness in two-way travel time (TWT) yields 340 ms, resulting in a thickness of 780 m with a p-wave average velocity for the interval of 2300 m/s (U1462C p-wave velocity data). Bedding is heterogeneous along strike line, with bidirectional bedding along the facies and mounded shape on the depocenter; along dip, bedding is partially homogeneous, following the regional tilting of X degrees. Lateral continuity of horizons within the Bare Fm. is dual along strike, showing both local lateral continuity with the carbonate rocks, and abrupt truncations. Three cycles of onlap/continuous set of seismic reflectors of the Trealla Fm. into the Bare Fm. are recognized (Figure 5). In the northern limits of the Bare Fm., analysis of the dip lines sheds light on the position of the sandstones along the shelf: seismic horizons from both coastal facies and deep-water facies onlap into the mounded-shape facies of the Bare Fm., showing a detached character of these sandstones in that areas. On the southern limit, instead, seismic horizons are continuous both landward and basinward. Three chronostratigraphic intervals are determined based on age control points at U1462C:</div><div></div><div>Late-Miocene chronostratigraphic interval comprises the deepest portion of the Bare Fm. Seismic-core correlation in U1463B followed by seismic interpretation gives an initiation of deposition at XXX Ma (Middle Miocene). Basal contact is erosional, with incisions of relief up to XXX ms TWT in some areas (XXX m, with 2300 m/s velocity; Figure 6a). Along strike, seismic reflectors are mounded-shape and bidirectional (SW-NE). Reflectors terminations are either truncation or downlap, and basal contact is erosional (Figure 4). Along dip, morphology is characterized by two seismic bodies (mound 1 and 2; Figure 6b). Mound 1 is 50 km long, up to 6 km wide, and 50 ms TWT thick (115 m; with 2300 m/s velocity). In the seismic slice, mound 1 is sigmoidal, elongated, with cross-stratification subparallel to SW-NE (Figure 6c). As the mound develops through time, it retrogrades landward, while its front migrates NE. Mound 2 is 26 km long, up to 5 km wide, and 70 ms TWT thick (160 m; with 2300 m/s velocity). Mound 2 is elongated, with oblique cross stratifications in the SW-NE direction (Figure 6d). Messinian - Piacenzian (5.59 – 3.47 Ma) seismic interval marks the thickest package of sedimentation of the Bare Fm. It also marks the full development of mound 3 at the depocenter and the peak of progradation of the Bare Fm. (Figure 6e). Coherence and seismic slices reveal a shift in the depositional patterns from the previous interval. Mound 3 is dip-oriented, with X m in the strike direction, and X m in the dip direction at its maximum size, near the top limit of the interval. Piacenzian – Gelasian (3.47 – 1.93 Ma) seismic interval reveals the final stage of siliciclastic deposition and the establishment of a retrogradational pattern following the peak in progradation at ~3.47 Ma. Mound 3 gradually decreases in size and migrates NE, as sediment supply is reduced. At the top of the interval (~1.93 Ma) retrogradation accelerates, and the seismic facies that characterizes the Bare Fm. vanishes.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><ul><li>Depositional System – Deltaic vs. Beach Barrier</li></ul></h3><div>Sanchez et al., (2016, 2012b) suggested that siliciclastic deposition of the Bare Fm. occurred as a result of a deltaic progradation over the carbonate-dominated shelf during the Late Miocene, that extended towards the shelf-edge. An alternative interpretation proposed that the absence of fluvial channels recognizable in 3D seismic data, the along-strike orientation of the deposits, and the overall regional geology interpreted for the period would advocate for a beach-barrier system (Smith et al., 2014; O’Callaghan et al., 2014; Griben et al., 2016). Our analysis contributes to untie the present duality in the interpretation of the depositional system.</div><div></div><div>Paleodepth estimation of IODP U1462 site does not further detail Late Miocene paleobathymetry, due to the lack of representative fossils samples in the period (Gallagher et al., 2017a). However, lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of site U1464 recognized near-shore facies for the middle-late Miocene, between 0-50 m paleodepth. The presence of strike-oriented bodies, lateral accretion, karstification, and anhydrite nodules, further support the interpretation of a near-shore environment, under the effect of wave action, shallow-water currents, and eventually exposed.</div><div></div><div>Additionally, a mixed siliciclastic/carbonate coastal system is interpreted for Unit IV of U1464, in the middle-late Miocene period (12.12 - 5.59 Ma; McHugh et al., 2017, AGU). In a semi-restricted sabkha environment, sandstones occur in the form of sand dunes in the backshore, beach ridges and channel inlets in the nearshore, and sandbars and beach barriers in the shoreface&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Warren_1985}</cite>. In these systems, karstification and sinkhole activity occur by subaerial exposure of evaporates during sea-level falls, and has been associated with falling stage system tracts (FSTT; &nbsp;(Raine et al., 2017). We interpret that the basal interval of the Bare Fm. formed in a sabkha depositional system, in the form of beach barriers and/or sand bars. Bare Fm. deposition initiates after the global middle Miocene sea-level fall, following the middle-Miocene climatic optimum, that exposed the shelf, resulting in karstification and the development of the mixed siliciclastic/carbonate system. However, such interpretation for the Messinian - Piacenzian (5.59 – 3.47 Ma) interval is not as clear, as a dip-oriented sedimentary mound appears.</div><div></div><div>Two main hypotheses may be considered for the upper deposition: a beach spit system within a broader beach-barrier system, concomitantly with sandstone reworking and an increase in sediment supply; or a point-based source, in a form of a fluvial/deltaic environment. Then again, large-scale fluvial channels, channel belts, and deltaic forms are usually recognizable at the scale of the seismic survey, but no indication of fluvial channels and channel belts were found in the seismic analysis. Fluvial channel incisions and channel filling, considering the volume of siliciclastic sedimentation, would also be expected, but none was identified in the seismic area.</div><div></div><div>Previous studies have pointed to the high degree of similarity between features Gilbert-type deltas and beach spit systems, highlighting the presence of giant-scale crossbedding in both systems <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Nielsen_1988}</cite>. Wave and longshore processes are also common in wave-dominated deltas <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bhattacharya_2003}</cite>, adding more difficulty to correctly interpret these systems. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Evans_1942}</cite>&nbsp;described the characteristics and heterogeneity of spits and related structures, and defined a spit as a ridge of sediment attached to the land mass on one end and terminating in open water at the other, being younger than the land mass to which it is attached. Subsequently, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Meistrell_1972}</cite>&nbsp;defined spit platform as a large-scale primary sedimentary structure formed by sediment transport along the coast and is a rise over the shelf but below mean low tide. A spit, by that definition, is a sediment ridge on the spit platform. According to the model, initiation of a spit system occurs when oblique waves create an oblique bar-trough system on the platform in the surf zone along the seaward side of the spit, and sand is transported forward to the edge of the platform by trough currents and migration of bars&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Nielsen_1988}</cite>.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nielsen_1988}</cite></div><div></div><div>We consider the depositional system of the Bare Fm. to be analogous to a spit-platform system, within a broader beach-barrier system that developed over the sabkha environment, in three distinct phases (Figure 7):</div><ul><li>phase 1; formation of mounds 1 and 2, in a sabkha environment transitioning to a beach-barrier system. due to an increase in siliciclastic supply.

Additional cooling during Late Miocene is interrupted by a subtle warming trend in the early Pliocene (6 Ma) until ~3.2 Ma <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>. Continued sea surface cooling was accompanied by increasingly wet conditions in southwestern Australia reaching a maximum at ~8 Ma (Groeneveld et al., 2017. in review). Arid conditions in northwestern Australia were similar to today’s, and persisted for most of the Miocene, while southwestern Australia became continuously wetter during the late Miocene until ~8 Ma (Groeneveld et al., 2017. in review). From Late Miocene to Pleistocene, as Australia continent moved north, it influenced regional and global climate. Northwest Australia underwent an abrupt transition to humid conditions at 5.5 Ma, lasting until 3.3 Ma, and followed by a transitional interval characterized by a progressive moisture reduction, culminating in an Arid Interval after ~2.4 Ma (Christensen et al., 2017. in review).</div><div></div><div>Siliciclastic transport to margins is mostly performed by fluvial systems, that in turn, are ultimately controlled by climate conditions (e.g. humidity and run-off;). Given the regional variability of the climate at the time of Bare Fm. development, a linkage between those processes is expected. Increasing cooling and wetting conditions in the Middle Miocene of Western Australia (reaching its maximum at 8 Ma), propitiously engendered siliciclastic transport and deposition to the margin. Internal variation in the depositional system of the Bare Fm. at ~5.59 Ma, and a peak in sedimentation following it (~5.59 – 3.47 Ma) is possibly linked to a regional transition to humid conditions (5.5 - 3.3 Ma). Next, a gradual decrease in sediment supply, and the subsequent termination of siliciclastic deposition may represent the sedimentary response to the emergence of an arid period after ~2.4 Ma.</div><div></div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><ul><li>Importance for Global Middle to late Miocene Tectonics and Climate</li></ul></h3><div>The Neogene period is marked by dramatic changes in climate and tectonic patterns, that affected sea level and sediment supply rates and, consequently, continental margin evolution <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Potter_2009,Potter_2015}</cite>.

Potter and Szatmari (2009, 2015) suggest that the increase in sedimentation rates and the alteration in climate patterns developed during the Miocene are result of tectonic processes, that led to an increase in ice sheet development, a reorganization in the global oceanic currents, and a peak in tectonic orogeny elsewhere, modifying global climate and establishing a cooling trend after the mid-Miocene climatic optimum <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zachos_2001}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>A likely interpretation is that ice-sheet development and an increase in aridity resulted in lower sea level, reduced vegetation cover, and increasing in erosion rates.

At the same time, new orogenic areas also contributed to the increased rates of sediment supply to margins. Those processes are recorded in the stratigraphy on many continental margins.
