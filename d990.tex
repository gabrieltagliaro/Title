\subsubsection{}Data
Sites MBAS-6A, MBAS-8A and MBAS-9A are planned to recover Neogene sediments (Figure 1; Hobbs et al., 2016). Proceeding chapters of IODP 369 will include lithological descriptions, biostratigraphic ages. Logging tools include gamma ray, color reflectance, porosity, density, magnetic susceptibility, uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations.
